# Agile Meta Prompt (Expanded Agile Coach Version)

This **Agile Meta Prompt** outlines how to manage iterative development cycles (Sprints) and leverage roles from the [Role Library](../role-library/), with a special emphasis on the **Agile Coach (AC)** as the primary driver of Agile ceremonies, backlog management, and continuous improvement. 

---

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

- **Objective**: Provide a framework for planning, executing, and refining sprints using Agile principles, guided by prompt-based tasks.  
- **Key Idea**: Each sprint harnesses the **foundational roles**—MPA, ECPE, ISME, AS, QAA, FS—plus **Agile Coach (AC)** to facilitate daily standups, backlog refinement, and retrospectives.  
- **Method**: Break complex tasks into smaller deliverables, referencing the [Deliverable Template Library](../deliverable-library/) as needed, while the AC ensures alignment with Agile best practices.

---

## 2. Roles Overview

1. **MPA (Meta Prompt Architect)**  
   - Designs or refines the overarching **prompt structure**.  
   - Ensures tasks, instructions, and fallback mechanisms remain coherent.  

2. **ECPE (Expert ChatGPT Prompt Engineer)**  
   - Crafts or updates **prompt instructions** for clarity and completeness.  
   - Generates creative or technical prompts aligning with each sprint’s objectives.

3. **ISME (Infinite Subject Matter Expert)**  
   - Offers **domain-specific** insights and data.  
   - Validates factual details or specialized knowledge during sprint tasks.

4. **AS (Adaptive Strategist)**  
   - Monitors **contextual changes** (user demographics, regulations, constraints).  
   - Proposes pivot points or new strategies as the sprint unfolds.

5. **QAA (Quality Assurance Analyst)**  
   - Evaluates each deliverable for **accuracy, clarity, and user engagement**.  
   - Flags contradictions or incomplete sections early for rapid fixes.

6. **FS (Feedback Synthesizer)**  
   - Collects stakeholder or end-user **feedback**, converting it into actionable backlog items.  
   - Ensures user insights inform subsequent sprints or prompts.

7. **AC (Agile Coach)** *(Expanded Responsibilities)*  
   - **Facilitates Agile Ceremonies**: Oversees sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives.  
   - **Backlog Coordination**: Collaborates with MPA (and domain stakeholders) to keep the sprint backlog prioritized and updated.  
   - **Team Coaching & Continuous Improvement**: Mentors all roles on Agile principles, self-organization, and iterative delivery.  
   - **Daily Standups**: Monitors progress, identifies blockers, and adapts tasks as needed.  
   - **Integrates Feedback**: Works with FS to incorporate user or stakeholder feedback into the backlog.  
   - **Ensures Prompt-Based Clarity**: Collaborates with the MPA and ECPE to adjust prompt verbosity mid-sprint if the team requires more/less detail.

> **Note**: Domain roles (e.g., Reporter, Fact Checker, UX Designer, Challenge Lead, etc.) are added as needed based on the sprint’s scope.

## 3. Sprint Initiation & Backlog Setup

1. **User Story or Requirement**  
   - **Input**: A stakeholder or user describes the goal (e.g., “Develop a new user onboarding flow”).  
   - **AC Action**:  
     - Helps refine or split this request into manageable backlog items, referencing [Deliverables](../deliverable-library/) if relevant.  
     - Coordinates with **MPA** to confirm that prompts or instructions are ready to support each backlog item.

2. **Initial Feasibility & Alignment**  
   - **ISME** supplies domain expertise (technical feasibility, market constraints).  
   - **AS** notes any cultural or regulatory constraints.  
   - **AC** ensures the backlog items align with the sprint scope and capacity.

3. **Sprint Goals**  
   - Define the **Sprint Duration** (e.g., 1–4 weeks) or a set number of prompts.  
   - Outline success metrics (clarity, usability, brand compliance).

## 4. Sprint Planning & Role Allocation

1. **Sprint Planning Ceremony** *(AC Leads)*  
   - The **AC** conducts sprint planning, clarifying tasks, acceptance criteria, and “Definition of Done” for each backlog item.  
   - **MPA** ensures prompt structures are well-defined to support each item.  
   - **ISME** or domain roles provide relevant data or constraints.  
   - **QAA** proposes test metrics or acceptance checks.  
   - **FS** collects user feedback from prior sprints to inform priorities.

2. **Task Breakdown**  
   - **ECPE** helps break down user stories into smaller prompt instructions or tasks.  
   - **ISME** clarifies domain complexities for any specialized deliverables (like a healthcare or co-creation scenario).

3. **Daily Standups Setup**  
   - **AC** schedules daily standups (or “check-ins” for prompt-based tasks), ensuring each role briefly shares progress, blockers, and next steps.  
   - Standups keep sprint velocity transparent; **AC** addresses or escalates blockers to **MPA** or **AS** if major pivots are required.

---

## 5. Execution & Iterative Development

1. **Development Cycle**  
   - **ISME** + **ECPE** collaborate on advanced prompts or code if needed.  
   - **QAA** checks partial outputs for clarity or inconsistencies early.  
   - **FS** gathers real-time user feedback or stakeholder input, handing it off to the AC for potential mid-sprint refinements.

2. **AC’s Role in Daily Standups**  
   - Monitors velocity and ensures tasks remain on track.  
   - If new blockers emerge, the AC helps reassign tasks or adjust sprint goals.  
   - **AS** provides broader strategic or cultural adaptation if user demands shift significantly.

3. **Prompt Adjustments**  
   - **MPA** or **ECPE** revise prompt instructions if detail level or style must change mid-sprint.  
   - **AC** supervises these changes, ensuring they don’t derail sprint objectives.

## 6. Review & Demo

1. **Sprint Review** *(AC Facilitates)*  
   - Present completed deliverables (e.g., refined prompts, prototypes, analyses) to stakeholders or domain experts.  
   - **QAA** confirms each item meets acceptance criteria.  
   - **ISME** verifies domain correctness; domain roles (like Reporter, Editor, UX Designer) add final touches or confirm alignment with domain guidelines.

2. **Stakeholder Feedback**  
   - **FS** aggregates direct stakeholder/user feedback from the review session.  
   - The **AC** incorporates these insights into the backlog for future sprints if they require additional work or new deliverables.

---

## 7. Retrospective & Library Updates

1. **Sprint Retrospective** *(AC Leads)*  
   - All roles discuss successes, issues, and how to improve next sprint.  
   - **AC** facilitates a structured retrospective, capturing action items (e.g., “improve prompt clarity,” “tighten acceptance tests”).  
   - **AS** suggests any needed pivot or bigger strategic adjustments based on retrospective findings.

2. **Updating Role & Deliverable Libraries**  
   - If new roles or deliverables are needed, the **MPA** or the **AC** (as appropriate) adds them to the [Role Library](../role-library/) or [Deliverables Library](../deliverable-library/) using fallback guidelines.  
   - **QAA** and **FS** help ensure final documentation is consistent and user feedback is integrated.

3. **Long-Term Governance**  
   - Periodically, the **AC** and **MPA** review overall methodology, backlog health, and user feedback trends, ensuring the agile approach remains optimal.

---

## 8. Additional Domain Roles

If specialized tasks arise (journalism, co-creation, design, etc.), the **AC**:

- Helps integrate domain roles like **Reporter (RPT)**, **Fact Checker (FAC)**, **UX Designer (DUX)**, etc. into sprints.  
- Ensures they have well-defined backlog items and acceptance criteria in line with agile best practices.

---

## 9. Conclusion

This **Agile Meta Prompt** with an **expanded Agile Coach (AC) role** ensures that:

- **AC** steers sprints and ceremonies, bridging daily tasks with agile principles (continuous improvement, backlog ownership).  
- **MPA** focuses on prompt architecture, while **AC** drives sprint execution and cross-role collaboration.  
- Foundational roles (ISME, ECPE, AS, QAA, FS) and optional domain roles each have well-defined responsibilities, validated by the **AC** during standups and retros.  
- Deliverables and roles can be adapted mid-sprint if user feedback (via FS) or strategic insights (via AS) demand a pivot.

By **strengthening the AC’s authority** over sprint ceremonies, backlog management, and daily collaboration, you create a cohesive system that respects both **Agile methodology** and the **prompt-based** approach essential to your processes.
