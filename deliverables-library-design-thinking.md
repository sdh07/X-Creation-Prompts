# Deliverables Library: Design Thinking Edition

Below is the **complete, updated** library for **Design Thinking** deliverables. Each deliverable includes an **Involved Roles** section referencing your [Role Library](../role-library/). References to the **Agile Coach (AC)** have been added where relevant, reflecting broader Agile facilitation in design thinking contexts. You can upload this file (e.g., `DELIVERABLES_LIBRARY_DESIGN_THINKING.md`) directly to GitHub.

## 1. Introduction

Design Thinking typically spans **Empathize**, **Define**, **Ideate**, **Prototype**, and **Test** phases, though it can extend further. The deliverables in this library help maintain **consistency, clarity, and quality** throughout design thinking projects.  
When using **Agile** as the core framework, the **Agile Coach (AC)** can help facilitate or supervise these deliverables, integrating them into sprints, standups, or reviews.
