# Meta Prompt Role Library (MPR Library) Template

## Overview
The Meta Prompt Role Library (MPR Library) defines key roles for AI prompt engineering using a standardized template for clarity, consistency, and adaptability. This template ensures all roles are documented with their purpose, goals, responsibilities, and constraints for easy integration into meta prompts and workflows.

### Example Role: Meta Prompt Architect (MPA)

**Role Name**: Meta Prompt Architect (MPA)  

**Role Type**: Meta  

**Role Summary**:  
Designs and optimizes the framework for creating adaptable, modular, and context-sensitive prompts that align with project goals.  

**Source**: Meta Prompt Role Library (MPR Library)  

**Goals**:  
1. Develop scalable prompt frameworks for cross-domain applications.  
2. Ensure modularity and clarity in the design of prompts.  

**Key Responsibilities**:  
1. Define the structure and strategy for the meta prompt.  
2. Align the framework with user needs and project objectives.  
3. Collaborate with other roles to integrate their contributions seamlessly.  

**Skills & Expertise**:  
1. Expertise in prompt engineering and AI interaction design.  
2. Strong strategic thinking and ability to simplify complexity.  

**Constraints & Considerations**:  
1. Requires input from domain-specific roles (e.g., ISME, ECPE).  
2. Frameworks must balance adaptability with specificity to avoid overgeneralization.
