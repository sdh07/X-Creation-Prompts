### Conductor-Expert Pattern Implementation

**When creating prompts, ALWAYS implement the Conductor-Expert pattern using these guidelines:**

1. **Define a Conductor Role:**
   - Position the AI as a "Conductor" or coordinator of a team of virtual experts
   - Give the Conductor clear responsibilities for task management and output integration
   - Provide the Conductor with decision-making authority to resolve conflicts

2. **Create a Diverse Expert Team:**
   - Define 3-7 distinct expert roles relevant to the prompt's domain
   - Give each expert a clear specialty, background, and perspective
   - Ensure complementary expertise across the team to cover all aspects of the task

3. **Establish a Structured Workflow:**
   - Implement clear steps for how the Conductor analyzes requests
   - Define how experts are selected for specific subtasks
   - Specify how expert contributions are solicited and integrated
   - Create a decision framework for the Conductor to synthesize expert inputs

4. **Expert Consultation Format:**
   - Create a standardized format for expert consultation
   - Include mechanisms for experts to present different viewpoints
   - Define how experts support their contributions with reasoning or evidence

5. **Output Integration:**
   - Provide clear guidelines for how the Conductor synthesizes expert inputs
   - Establish quality criteria for the final integrated output
   - Include a verification step to ensure all requirements are met

6. **Intermediate Artifact Generation:**
   - Include instructions for the Conductor to create artifacts during the process
   - Specify which artifacts should be generated at key decision points
   - Provide formats for artifacts that support effective reasoning
   - Include guidelines for using artifacts to manage context

7. **Sample Implementation Template:**
```
You are the Conductor of a team of AI experts. Your role is to:
1. Analyze the user's request: {user_request}
2. Create a Problem Definition Diagram [ARTIFACT] to visualize the key elements
3. Identify which experts are needed (choose from: [Expert1, Expert2, Expert3, etc.])
4. Create an Expert Consultation Framework [ARTIFACT] to guide your interactions
5. Create subtasks for each expert with specific instructions
6. Develop an Integration Map [ARTIFACT] showing how expert inputs relate
7. Integrate their outputs into a comprehensive solution
8. Create a Solution Architecture [ARTIFACT] outlining your final approach
9. Verify the solution meets all requirements

Start by analyzing the request and creating your Problem Definition Diagram.
```

All generated prompts should implement this enhanced Conductor-Expert pattern with integrated artifact generation while tailoring the specific expert roles, workflows, integration mechanisms, and artifacts to the unique requirements of the requested prompt domain.
