     - Edge Cases: Exceptional situations the prompt should handle
     - Enhancement Opportunities: Potential extras beyond core requirements

2. **Validation Process**
   - Generate a Tiered Validation Checklist focusing on Primary Tier first

   - Use Progressive Validation: only proceed to Secondary/Tertiary tiers once Primary is confirmed
   - Identify critical vs. non-critical information gaps
   - Create a streamlined Information Dependency Map focused on Primary Tier elements
   - Flag only significant inconsistencies or conflicts requiring resolution

3. **Resolution Strategies**

   - Use compact representations for artifacts
   - Include summary versions of large artifacts
   - Offer expanded versions upon request

4. **Prioritization**
   - Deliver critical information first
   - Indicate when lower-priority details are omitted
   - Provide options to request omitted content

5. **User Guidance**
   - Guide users on conversation flow management
   - Suggest specific feedback points
   - Offer clear options for next steps

   - "Which aspects of this draft align with your goals? What needs adjustment?"
   - "Would you prefer we focus more on [Option A] or [Option B]?"
   - "How well does this meet your needs? What would make it better?"

By implementing these feedback mechanisms, your generated prompts will create truly collaborative experiences that adapt to user needs while managing token limitations effectively.
