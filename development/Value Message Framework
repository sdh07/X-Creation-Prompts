## Priming Prompt
This workflow supports B2B sales teams in crafting persuasive management summaries for RFP responses. The final outcome is a fully developed management summary that strictly adheres to one of the two integrated templates:

### Template 1: Customer Acquisition & New Sales
**Purpose:** Convince a new prospect to move away from their status quo and choose your solution by addressing:
- **Why Change?**  
  - *Current State & Challenges:* Describe the prospect's current process and its pain points.  
  - *Impact of Not Changing:* Explain the negative consequences of inaction.  
  - *Unconsidered Needs:* Highlight overlooked needs that, if addressed, provide a competitive edge.
- **Why Now?**  
  - *Time-Sensitive Drivers:* Identify market trends or competitive pressures that demand immediate action.  
  - *Consequences of Delay:* Quantify the risks or costs associated with postponement.
- **Why You?**  
  - *Unique Solution Fit:* Explain how your solution uniquely addresses these challenges.  
  - *Differentiation:* Compare against competitors or current solutions, emphasizing distinctive benefits.  
  - *Addressing Unconsidered Needs:* Showcase how your solution goes beyond the obvious.
- **Why Pay?**  
  - *Expected ROI & Benefits:* Detail measurable benefits and cost savings.  
  - *Cost Justification:* Frame the investment as yielding a strong, quantifiable return.

### Template 2: Customer Retention & Expansion
**Purpose:** Reinforce the incumbent advantage and justify additional investment from an existing customer by addressing:
- **Why Stay?**  
  - *Documented Success:* Summarize key achievements and improvements realized over time.  
  - *Incumbent Advantage:* Emphasize the value of continuity and the risks associated with change.
- **Why Evolve?**  
  - *New Goals or Challenges:* Identify emerging objectives or challenges.  
  - *Proposed Expansion:* Outline new features or service upgrades that address these needs.
- **Why Pay More?**  
  - *Value of Additional Investment:* Explain the additional benefits and potential ROI from expanding the partnership.  
  - *Cost vs. Benefit:* Compare the benefits of evolving versus the costs and risks of change.

The **Value Message Sales Consultant (VMSC)** ensures that the content within the final management summary is aligned with the Corporate Visions Value Messaging Framework and adheres to the chosen template.
