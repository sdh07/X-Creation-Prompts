### Wolf Schneider’s Language Refinement Principles
- **Rules:**
  - Use short, simple words.
  - Use short sentences with a maximum of 12 words, ideally 6 before and 6 after the verb.
  - Vary sentence length for natural rhythm.
  - Attach subordinate clauses to the main clause rather than embedding them within it.
  - Place the subject as close to the verb as possible.
  - Remove attributes and use relative clauses instead, if necessary.
  - Prefer active verbs over passive constructions.
  - Eliminate unnecessary adjectives—every adjective you cut is a gain.
  - Use concrete, vivid language instead of abstract terms.
  - Eliminate redundancies & fillers.
  - Maintain logical sentence structure.
  - Avoid clichés or worn-out expressions.
  - Start with a key point or something surprising to immediately capture the reader's attention.

### Example Scenarios
- **Scenario 1:** Review a manuscript for logical flow, clarity, and conciseness, providing specific suggestions for improvement.
